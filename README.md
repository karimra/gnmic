`gnmic` (_pronoun.: gee路en路em路eye路see_) is a gNMI CLI client that provides full support for Capabilities, Get, Set and Subscribe RPCs with collector capabilities.

Documentation available at [https://gnmic.kmrd.dev](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev)

## Features

* **Full support for gNMI RPCs**  
  Every gNMI RPC has a [corresponding command](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/basic_usage/) with all of the RPC options configurable by means of the local and global flags.
* **Flexible collector deployment**  
  `gnmic` can be deployed as a gNMI collector that supports multiple output types ([NATS](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/outputs/nats_output/), [Kafka](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/outputs/kafka_output/), [Prometheus](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/outputs/prometheus_output/), [InfluxDB](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/outputs/influxdb_output/),...).  
  The collector can be deployed either as a [single instance](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/deployments/deployments_intro/#single-instance), as part of a [cluster](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/HA/), or used to form [data pipelines](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/deployments/deployments_intro/#pipelines).
* **Support gRPC tunnel based dialout telemetry**  
  `gnmic` can be deployed as a gNMI collector with an [embedded tunnel server](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/tunnel_server/).
* **gNMI data manipulation**  
  `gnmic` collector has [data transformation](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/event_processors/intro/) capabilities that can be used to adapt the collected data to your specific use case.
* **Dynamic targets loading**  
  `gnmic` support [target loading at runtime](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/target_discovery/discovery_intro/) based on input from external systems.
* **YANG-based path suggestions**  
  Your CLI magically becomes a YANG browser when `gnmic` is executed in [prompt](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/prompt_suggestions/) mode. In this mode the flags that take XPATH values will get auto-suggestions based on the provided YANG modules. In other words - voodoo magic :exploding_head:
* **Multi-target operations**  
  Commands can operate on [multiple gNMI targets](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/targets/) for bulk configuration/retrieval/subscription.
* **Multiple configuration sources**  
  gnmic supports [flags](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/configuration_flags), [environment variables](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/configuration_env/) as well as [file based]((https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/configuration_file/)) configurations.
* **Inspect raw gNMI messages**  
  With the `prototext` output format you can see the actual gNMI messages being sent/received. Its like having a gNMI looking glass!
* **(In)secure gRPC connection**  
  gNMI client supports both TLS and [non-TLS](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/global_flags/#insecure) transports so you can start using it in a lab environment without having to care about the PKI.
* **Dial-out telemetry**  
  The [dial-out telemetry server](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/cmd/listen/) is provided for Nokia SR OS.
* **Pre-built multi-platform binaries**  
  Statically linked [binaries](https://github.com/karimra/gnmic/releases) made in our release pipeline are available for major operating systems and architectures. Making [installation](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/install/) a breeze!
* **Extensive and friendly documentation**  
  You won't be in need to dive into the source code to understand how `gnimc` works, our [documentation site](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev) has you covered.

```

### Get request

```
gnmic -a 10.1.0.11:57400 -u admin -p admin --insecure \

### Prompt mode

The [prompt mode](https://gnmic.kmrd.dev/user_guide/prompt_suggestions/) is an interactive mode of the gnmic CLI client for user convenience.

```bash
# clone repository with YANG models (Openconfig example)
git clone https://github.com/openconfig/public
cd public

# Start gnmic in prompt mode and read in all the modules:

gnmic --file release/models \
      --dir third_party \
      --exclude ietf-interfaces \
      prompt
```
